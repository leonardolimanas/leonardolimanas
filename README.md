## What I build

- SDKs and integration layers for AI platforms

- Developer-facing tooling with clear APIs and docs
- Experiments and apps spanning web, Python and data/ML workflows

## Core skills

- Languages: TypeScript, Python, JavaScript, Vue, Go, PHP
- Platform and tooling: SDK design, API integrations, GitHub automation
